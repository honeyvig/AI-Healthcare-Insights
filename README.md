There is an AI solution that I found called CLARA THERAPIST.

I am interested in finding the AI platform solution provider.  This job is an AI tool research job.

I'm interested in building a solution like Clara, but for a different industry.  I am not interested in building the solution, I'd rather rent/license/subscribe.

You can experience CLARA THERAPIST by dialing her US phone number:
three 2 1 - 5 2 9 - zero - four - two - two

If you can not find Clara's platform, provide a list of AI platforms that can perform the same solution.
======================
It appears that Clara Therapist may refer to multiple AI-driven solutions in different industries. One of the prominent AI platforms that you might be referring to is Clara by Clarify Health, a generative AI tool focused on transforming healthcare insights into actionable data using machine learning and natural language processing​

Another similar AI platform called Wellzy offers an AI therapist chatbot designed for mental health support, providing users with empathetic, non-judgmental therapy sessions and AI-assisted note-taking tools for healthcare providers​

.

If you're interested in a similar AI platform for a different industry, several platforms could meet your needs, depending on the focus area:

    Wellzy – An AI-powered chatbot solution tailored to therapy and wellness.
    Clarify Health's Clara – A healthcare-focused AI platform designed for high-performance healthcare insights, though its primary function centers around analytics rather than direct user-facing therapy​

To move forward with a similar AI solution, you might want to explore these platforms for licensing, subscription, or partnership opportunities in your industry.
